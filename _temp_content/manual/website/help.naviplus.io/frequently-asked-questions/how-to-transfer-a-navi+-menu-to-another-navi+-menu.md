# How to Transfer a Navi+ Menu to Another Navi+ Menu

Have you ever built a menu you really liked… and then realized you needed the same one somewhere else? 😅

Good news: you don’t have to rebuild it from scratch.

### When would you need to transfer a menu?

This is commonly needed in the following situations:

* You’ve completed a menu on mobile and want to use it on desktop (or vice versa)
* You’ve built a menu for one website and want to reuse it on another website, with a few adjustments to better fit the new design

Currently, there is no automatic tool that can transfer menus between Navi+ systems. So the most effective method for now is the classic but reliable: copy & paste.

### Step-by-step Guide

#### Step 1: Prepare the destination menu

First, set up the destination menu structure.

Create the base framework with Level 1 and Level 2 menu items so it’s ready to receive the transferred content

#### Step 2: Open both menus side by side

Open both menus in the same browser (for example, Chrome):

* One tab: Source menu (the menu that already has content)
* One tab: Destination menu (the menu you are transferring into)

Keeping them open side by side will make the process faster and help avoid mistakes.

🔁 Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until the entire menu structure has been fully transferred. Tips: Move the menu in sections (by level or by branch) to make sure nothing is missed and the structure stays organized.
