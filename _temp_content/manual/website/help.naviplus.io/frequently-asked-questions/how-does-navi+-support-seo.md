# How does Navi+ support SEO?

Links are one of the key factors in optimizing SEO with search engines. SEO optimization with links applies to both backlinks and internal links.

1. **Backlinks** (External Links)\
   Backlinks are links from other websites pointing to your site. These are an important factor in SEO.
   * **Quality over quantity**: Links from reputable websites are far more valuable than many links from unclear or low-quality sources.
   * **Natural links**: Natural, non-purchased or non-exchanged links are more beneficial for SEO.
   * **Anchor Text**: The text you use as a link should contain keywords relevant to the content of the page you’re linking to.
2. **Internal Links**\
   Internal links between pages on the same website help guide users and improve page rankings.
   * **Use internal links wisely**: Ensure that every important page on your website is linked from other pages.
   * **Relevant anchor text**: Use related keywords as anchor text for internal links to improve searchability.

Navi+ starts automatically supporting link-based SEO from the Elite plan. At that level, every link in the Navi+ menu is optimized with a full URL (ensuring proper indexing by search engines), anchor text, and related tags. Navi+ also supports image SEO by adding title and alt tags for optimizing image searches.

Adding your entire product catalog to the Navi+ menu is very beneficial for search engines, helping them understand the list of pages, sitemap, and keyword-related content. The speed of Navi+ is another major advantage for SEO. All libraries and resources (images, JS, and CSS) are hosted on top-tier CDN systems with response times under 100ms and stable caching, which boosts your SEO score.
