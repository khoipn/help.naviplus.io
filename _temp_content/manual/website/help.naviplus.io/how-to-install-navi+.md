# How to install Navi+

You don’t need to know about development or design to use Navi+. It’s a pre-built software that can be easily embedded into your website. All configuration — including features and visual design — is managed directly on Navi+, without causing any conflict with your existing system.

### Step 2: Create Menus and Embed Them into Your Website

Once you’ve logged in, you can start creating menus for your website.\
**Navi+** provides several types of menus to match different needs:

* **Tabbar**\
  A fixed navigation bar at the bottom of the screen, allowing users to access key sections quickly. Ideal for mobile layouts.
* **Mega Menu**\
  A large dropdown menu with multiple columns, perfect for displaying product categories or detailed content in a clear structure.
* **Slide Menu (Hamburger Menu)**\
  A hidden side menu that slides in from the edge of the screen. Great for saving space and maintaining a clean, modern design.
* **Floating Button Menu**\
  A floating action button that can open a list of quick links or highlight special campaigns or promotions.

Each type of menu has its own setup process, which is fully guided step-by-step inside the Navi+ dashboard.

You can also use multiple types of Navi+ menus at the same time on different pages — for example, a Tabbar for mobile, a Mega Menu for desktop, and a Floating Button for your call-to-action or promotions.
