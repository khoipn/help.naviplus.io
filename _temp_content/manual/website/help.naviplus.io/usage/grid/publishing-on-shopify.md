# Publishing on Shopify

### Step 2: (Shopify) Publish the menu on your website.

#### **I) METHOD 1: INSERT (BEFORE OR AFTER) THIS MENU AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION ON YOUR WEBSITE, OR REPLACE AN EXISTING MENU, USING A CSS SELECTOR. (**&#x52;ECOMMENDED)

#### I.1. Turn on Navi+ on App Embeds

Step 1: Click Online Store, then click Themes. Tips: Right-click on Online Store and select “Open Link in New Tab” to save time.&#x20;

Step 2: Select the theme where you want to publish the menu.  Click: **Customize**

* If your website is new and has no users yet, feel free to publish the menu without worry—you can easily turn it on or off at any time without affecting visitors.
* If your website already has regular traffic, be more careful. The best practice is to create a **duplicate Theme** and test Navi+ on that version first.

Step 4: Don’t forget to click “Save” to apply the changes.

After these 4 steps, Navi+ has been installed on your website and is ready to display. However, the process is not yet complete. Go back to the Navi+ app tab to actually turn on **Publish Menu**.

#### I.2. Select display settings and publish the menu.

Step 1: Click the **Publish to website** button.

Step 3: Select the correct CSS Selector and replace/insert method

In this guide, we’ll focus on 1 ways: inserting this menu before the main. You can also use this method creatively by finding and applying other CSS selectors to trigger the menu.

To do this, simply identify the CSS selector of your website’s header enter it into the textbox. We’ve already found the CSS selectors for some of the most popular themes for you, listed below.

#### **II) METHOD 2: ADD THIS MENU AS A SECTION/BLOCK IN THE SHOPIFY THEME**

This method inserts the menu by adding a Block/Section in your Shopify theme. It’s a traditional approach, so I won’t describe it in detail. With this method, you don’t even need to **“Turn on Navi+ in App Embeds”** as required in Step 1 of Method 1.

Copy Embed ID of this menu, then insert to block named "Navi+ on Section" on Theme Sections. You can add a title, set up full width, and adjust the margin for this section after adding it.
