# FAQ

#### Question 1: Why doesn’t Navi+ automatically display the desktop Mega Menu on mobile devices?

The browsing experience on desktop and mobile is fundamentally different — especially in how users navigate and interact with a website.

On desktop, users have more screen space and can easily view large, complex mega menus displayed under the header.

However, on mobile, the screen is smaller and users navigate mainly with their thumbs, so showing the same mega menu would make the interface cluttered, hard to tap, and slower to load.

That’s why Navi+ doesn’t automatically convert a desktop mega menu into a mobile version.

Instead, you should create a dedicated mobile menu that provides a better user experience:

* Main menus — place them in a TabBar at the bottom of the screen, where they’re easy to reach with a thumb.
* Additional menus — move them into a Slide (Hamburger) menu (slide-out panel) or a mobile-specific Mega Menu.

👉 With Navi+’s convenient Copy & Paste menu feature, you can duplicate your desktop mega menu and adapt it for mobile in just a few minutes — giving you full control and ensuring both versions are perfectly optimized for their platforms.
