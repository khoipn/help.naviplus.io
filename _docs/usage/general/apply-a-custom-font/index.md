# Apply a custom font

Navi+ offers a wide selection of Google Fonts, providing an optimized and convenient way to style your menu. Google Fonts are fast, highly legible, and widely supported, making them an excellent choice for most designs. However, if you’d like to use a custom font that is not included in the default selection, you can manually apply it to your Navi+ menu. Here’s how:

For example, if you have purchased the **Honey Salt** font from [MJ Type](https://mjtype.com/product/honey-salt/ "MJ Type") and want to use it in your Navi+ menu, simply add the following CSS code to the **Internal Stylesheet / CSS** section:

```
{
  font-family: "Honey Salt";
}
```
