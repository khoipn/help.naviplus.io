# Publishing on Shopify

### Step 2: (Shopify) Publish the menu on your website.

#### **I) METHOD 1: INSERT (BEFORE OR AFTER) THIS MENU AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION ON YOUR WEBSITE, OR REPLACE AN EXISTING MENU, USING A CSS SELECTOR. (**&#x52;ECOMMENDED)

#### I.1. Turn on Navi+ on App Embeds

Step 1: Click Online Store, then click Themes. Tips: Right-click on Online Store and select “Open Link in New Tab” to save time.&#x20;

Step 2: Select the theme where you want to publish the menu.  Click: **Customize**

* If your website is new and has no users yet, feel free to publish the menu without worry—you can easily turn it on or off at any time without affecting visitors.
* If your website already has regular traffic, be more careful. The best practice is to create a **duplicate Theme** and test Navi+ on that version first.

Step 3: Go to App embeds, find “Navi+ on All pages”, and turn it on.

Step 4: Don’t forget to click “Save” to apply the changes.

After these 4 steps, Navi+ has been installed on your website and is ready to display. However, the process is not yet complete. Go back to the Navi+ app tab to actually turn on **Publish Menu**.

#### I.2. Select display settings and publish the menu.

Step 1: Click the **Publish to website** button.

Step 2: Turn on toggle "Publish menu by Insert/Replace method".&#x20;

Step 3: Select the correct CSS Selector and replace/insert method

In this guide, we’ll focus on 2 ways: inserting this menu below the header or replacing the default Mega Menu. You can also use this method creatively by finding and applying other CSS selectors to trigger the menu.

**I.3. Important! Optimize Mega Menu speed and user experience (Replacement mode)**

When you replace one menu with another, Navi+ waits until the old menu is displayed and then instantly swaps it with the new one. Although this happens almost immediately, there is still a brief moment where the old menu appears, which may confuse users.

With this step, you can completely hide the old menu and show a loading effect instead. This makes the website feel faster and improves the user experience.

<details><summary>Navi+ provides a simple solution to optimize the user experience and speed as follows steps</summary>
<h4>Why do you need to do this? Isn’t Navi+ already fast?</h4>
<p>Navi+ is very fast. It is fully deployed on a leading CDN with very low latency (around 100ms) and can serve millions of customers without slowing down.</p>
<p>However, Navi+ still runs within the Shopify ecosystem. Shopify has its own loading rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shopify prioritizes loading its own resources first.</li>
<li>Then Shopify loads the theme content.</li>
<li>Finally, Shopify loads app content, but not in any specific order.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means if you are using multiple apps, Navi+ may sometimes be loaded later than expected. That’s why it can feel slower in certain cases.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What is my solution?</h3>
<p>Currently, Navi+ has high priority when loading on Shopify websites. However, there is still a certain delay. We will address these issues one by one here:</p>

<li>Add the suffix <strong>(M)</strong> if you want it to apply only on mobile.</li>

<li>Leave no suffix if you want it to apply on both platforms.</li>

#### **II) METHOD 2: ADD THIS MENU AS A SECTION/BLOCK IN THE SHOPIFY THEME**

This method inserts the menu by adding a Block/Section in your Shopify theme. It’s a traditional approach, so I won’t describe it in detail. With this method, you don’t even need to **“Turn on Navi+ in App Embeds”** as required in Step 1 of Method 1.

Copy Embed ID of this menu, then insert to block named "Navi+ on Section" on Theme Sections. You can add a title, set up full width, and adjust the margin for this section after adding it.
