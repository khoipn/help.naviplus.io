### 3. Is Navi+ fast? Does it affect website speed?

Some users ask: *“Will Navi+ slow down my website?”.* The answer is **no** — Navi+ is built to be **fast, lightweight, and stable**.

Navigation is one of the most critical parts of any website’s user experience. It must always load instantly and run smoothly, since it directly affects how visitors explore your site and make purchase decisions.

In practice, Navi+ handles millions of requests every day across all customer websites with no performance drop. As of Nov 2025, Navi+ processed over 2 million requests, 80+ GB of bandwidth, and more than 400,000+ clicks to navigate daily.

This stability is possible because the backend is hosted on AWS, while all front-end assets are delivered globally through the [Cloudflare CDN](https://cloudflare.com "Cloudflare CDN"). This separation ensures multiple layers of protection — your site display remains stable even if the Navi+ backend is being upgraded. Such interruptions are extremely rare (around **0.0001%**).

Thanks to Cloudflare’s worldwide edge network, Navi+ loads in about 52 ms on average, even faster than Shopify’s own scripts.\
Caching mechanisms ensure it’s typically loaded only once per session, so users experience almost **zero wait time** anywhere in the world.

Navi+ on Shopify is also officially recognized as “Built for Shopify,” meeting Shopify’s strict standards for speed, design quality, and reliability.\\

### 4. How is Navi+ different from other applications on the market?

Navi+ is not a theme. It’s an independent interface layer focused entirely on navigation experience — helping you add advanced menus, floating buttons, banners, and interaction tools to any existing theme.

Whether you’re using Shopify, WordPress, WooCommerce, Wix, Webflow, or Squarespace, Navi+ works seamlessly with both free and premium themes.

Most web themes are desktop-first and only *mobile-friendly*. This means the mobile experience often receives less design attention.\
Navi+ was created to fix that — to elevate your website’s mobile experience and make it truly engaging and conversion-focused.

In short, your theme builds the structure, but Navi+ brings it to life through better navigation and a richer user experience.\
