# Navi+ service plan policies. (Starter, Business & Elite)

### Question 1: What happens when my Starter plan exceeds 50,000 visits?

Navi+ offers a trial package with nearly full features for all websites. However, after a certain period, if the visits to your website (where visits are counted when Navi+ is displayed on the website) exceed 50,000, your account will automatically be flagged for an upgrade. We will take the following actions:

1. We will send multiple emails to notify you about the status of your Navi+ Starter plan (Please ensure you receive our notifications, as this is crucial). Upon receiving the notification, consider upgrading your account to a higher plan like Business or Elite.
2. If you do not receive the information or if your website does not intend to upgrade to a higher plan, we will start displaying small Navi+ ads on your menus. The size of the ads will not affect user interaction but will be noticeable enough for users to understand that the menu is powered by Navi+. We will consider gradually increasing the visibility of the ads over time, from very subtle to more noticeable. This helps Navi+ reach more people and generates additional revenue from other customers.
3. We will not disable or remove any features of Navi+ that are currently displayed on your site. We fully understand that these features are crucial for user interaction on your website, so this is something we will strictly avoid.

### **Question 2: What happens if you downgrade from Business or Elite back to Starter, yet it seems like all the features remain?**

We understand that features and user experience are crucial for your customers, so we ensure that no features on your menu will be hidden or removed. However, we have a system that performs a daily scan. As soon as it detects that your website is in this situation, we will send you an email notification to encourage you to upgrade to a higher plan. These email notifications will be spaced out over time to avoid overwhelming you with too many messages. If you choose not to upgrade back to the Business or Elite plans, Navi+ will start displaying ads as explained in Question 1.

### Question 3: What happens if I exceed the limit on the Business plan (e.g., more than 500,000 Navi+ views/month)?

As with the previous questions, Navi+ will not hide or remove any menu features. However, once the limit is exceeded, and after email notifications are sent to you to consider upgrading to the Elite plan, ads may be displayed on your menu until the start of a new monthly cycle.
