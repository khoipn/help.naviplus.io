# Getting Started

Navi+ \| Website Menu Builder helps you create beautiful and modern menus for your online store — such as Tabbar, Mega Menu, Slide (Hamburger) Menu, and Floating Button Menu — all in just a few clicks, no coding required.

It works smoothly with [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/ "Shopify"), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/ "Wix"), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/ "WordPress"), [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/ "WooCommerce"), [Webflow](https://webflow.com/ "Webflow"), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/ "Squarespace"), and many other platforms. Because everything runs on our cloud-based system, your menus can handle millions of visits per day without slowing down your website or requiring any server setup.

Start free with basic features for small websites, or upgrade to Business or Elite plans for more tools that help you improve user experience and boost sales.

With Navi+, your visitors can be gently guided toward what matters most — discovering key products, exploring your latest campaigns, or simply enjoying a well-structured and trustworthy website.\
Menus built with Navi+ help you tell a clear story about your brand and your business, building confidence and curiosity that encourage visitors to learn more and take action.

Navi+ \| Menu Builder is created by a small team with experience in e-commerce, marketing, sales, user experience design, and web technology.

We built it with a simple goal: to make it easier for anyone — no matter their technical background — to create better navigation and a better shopping experience.

Design smarter. Build better. With Navi+.
